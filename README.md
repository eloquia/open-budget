# Open Budget

*Open Budget* is a project that seeks to enhance budgeting spreadsheets with the following additions:

- An app that lets you view your spending, budgets, goals, and more
- Code to turn that spreadsheet into something available on multiple devices at home while keeping the spreadsheet a single-source of truth (no duplicating data)
- Possibility of accessing the spreadsheet through the app anywhere on earth

## Motivation

- Spreadsheet budgeting is limited: There are people that use a spreadsheet for budgeting. The problem with this is that it's only available on a desktop/laptop device. This means that in order to keep up with your finances, you would need your desktop device. Viewing spreadsheets on a mobile device isn't a great experience
- Other services want your money or your data: *Open Budget* is completely free and no one will have access to your data (unless you do something wrong in security, which we will get to)
