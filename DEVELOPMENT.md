# Development

## Getting Started

To run the app in dev mode: `cd quasar-project && quasar dev`

To run the API: `cd api && bun run dev`

## Tech Stack

I'm choosing this tech stack because:

- It's technology I'm familiar with
- It's technology that I want to work with

- UI
	- Quasar
		- iOS
		- Android
		- Desktop app
- API
	- Something to read a spreadsheet from a file on a computer
		- Host it on home network so that it can be read
		- Expose it to the network some how
			- Generate security at home network-level, like private-public key pair, and that private key can be put in the phone app
	- Support for Google Sheets using Google Sheet APIs?
- Database
	- Spreadsheet as the single-source of truth
	- Option to migrate?
